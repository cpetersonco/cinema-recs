# Specification Quality Checklist: Showtime Cancellation & Reschedule Alerts

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Scope was narrowed via an informed default (documented in Assumptions)
  rather than a [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker: only showtimes already
  covered by a feature-004 recommendation notification are eligible for
  cancellation/reschedule alerts, to avoid reproducing the noise problem
  feature 004's own P2 story was designed to prevent.
- The original request's "notified as soon as a new showtime is detected
  and recommended" half is already implemented by feature 004
  (see spec.md's note under User Scenarios); this feature covers only
  the previously-unbuilt cancellation/reschedule half.
